## Context

We are in a global health crisis due to Coronavirus. A lot of safety recommendation are given by every states's health authorities as social distancing, handwashing, or mask wearing.
This last one is maybe the most important one to reduce contamination, and that why in a lot of contry, a mask must be worn in public places.
Masklab.ai will help authorities to enforce mask wearing rules.

## What is Masklab.ai

Masklab.ai is a technological tool based on deep learning, face detection and mask wearing classification.
Masklab.ai is able to detect and identify from a video stream people that are not wearing a mask, or not correctly in a crowd.
the second objective is to provide analyzable statistics to authorities.
